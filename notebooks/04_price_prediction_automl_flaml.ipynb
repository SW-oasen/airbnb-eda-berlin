    "# 🚀 Berlin Airbnb Price Prediction - FLAML AutoML\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft FLAML\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the power of **FLAML (Fast and Lightweight AutoML)**, Microsoft's efficient automated machine learning library, for predicting Berlin Airbnb rental prices. FLAML optimizes both model performance and computational efficiency through intelligent algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 FLAML AutoML Advantages\n",
    "- **Efficient Algorithm Selection**: Smart search through algorithm space with cost-effective evaluation\n",
    "- **Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning**: Advanced optimization techniques (CFO - Cost-Frugal Optimization)\n",
    "- **Resource Awareness**: Balances model quality with computational budget constraints\n",
    "- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Optimizes for accuracy while minimizing training time and resources\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready**: Scalable solution suitable for production deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Dual Approach Strategy\n",
    "This analysis implements **two complementary modeling strategies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raw Price Prediction**: Direct modeling of actual price values for interpretable results\n",
    "2. **Log-Transformed Price Prediction**: Modeling log-prices to handle price distribution skewness and improve model stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 FLAML vs H2O AutoML Comparison\n",
    "While H2O AutoML focuses on comprehensive algorithm coverage and distributed processing, FLAML emphasizes:\n",
    "- **Cost-Effective Search**: Intelligent resource allocation during model selection\n",
    "- **Faster Convergence**: Efficient optimization algorithms for quicker results  \n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Lower memory footprint for resource-constrained environments\n",
    "- **Adaptive Sampling**: Dynamic adjustment of search strategy based on performance feedback"
